h2. Description

This projects is used to share some of the results of my scientific research on providing
Polish lexicon for the "Cyc ontology":http://opencyc.org 

h2. Files

* PolishLexicon.txt -- includes the mappings between about 2000 Cyc terms
  and their Polish text representations
* Infobox.txt -- includes the mappings between Polish Wikipedia infoboxes
  and the corresponding Cyc terms. These mappings will be used to assign
  "DBpedia":http://dbpedia.org ontology classes to the infoboxes, but
  since DBpedia ontology is much smaller than Cyc, those mappings will be less
  accurate.
