h1. Polish Cyc

h2. Description

This projects is used to share some of the results of my scientific research on providing
Polish lexicon for the "Cyc ontology":http://opencyc.org. 
Most of the results were manually reviewed, so they should be of rather high
accuracy.

h2. Files

* PolishLexicon.txt -- includes the mappings between about 2000 Cyc terms
  and their Polish text representations
* Infobox.txt -- includes the mappings between Polish Wikipedia infoboxes
  and the corresponding Cyc terms. These mappings will be used to assign
  "DBpedia":http://dbpedia.org ontology classes to the infoboxes, but
  since DBpedia ontology is much smaller than Cyc, those mappings will be less
  accurate.

h2. Development/errors

If you wish to provide additional mappings, fork the project and send a 
pull request. No topic branches needed.

If you see any errors in the files, but don't want to fork the project, 
please report them on the Github issue tracker.
