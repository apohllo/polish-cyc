h2. Description

This projects is used to share some of the results of our scientific research on providing
Polish lexicon for the "Cyc ontology":http://opencyc.org. 
Most of the results were manually reviewed, so they should be of high accuracy.

h2. Files

* PolishLexicon.txt -- includes the mappings between  13 thousands Cyc terms
  and their Polish text representations

* PolishLexicon_multiple.txt -- includes the mappings between 15 thousands of 
  Polish expressions and Cyc terms 

* Infobox.txt -- includes the mappings between Polish Wikipedia infoboxes
  and the corresponding Cyc terms. These mappings will be used to assign
  "DBpedia":http://dbpedia.org ontology classes to the infoboxes, but
  since DBpedia ontology is much smaller than Cyc, those mappings will be less
  accurate.

* Infobox_ignored.txt -- the infoboxes that were ignored in the mapping
  (they don't indicate the semantic class of an article).

h2. Development/errors
